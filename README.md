🚀 Getting Started
Requirements

    Compiler/toolchain: arm-none-eabi-gcc

    A 'Tactigotchi' official hardware kit!

Building the Firmware

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git
cd project
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

Flashing to Device

# Example for Raspberry Pi Pico (drag-and-drop)
cp firmware.uf2 /media/PI-PICO/

Or, using OpenOCD / pyOCD:

openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg
